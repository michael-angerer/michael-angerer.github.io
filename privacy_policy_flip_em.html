<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Thank you for downloading Flip 'EM! I am an independent developer who loves to create apps for you. My free apps are supported and financed with advertisement. This makes it possible to deliver them to you free of charge. The ads are shown using software from a third party. In this context certain information about your device might be needed. This document will provide an overview what kind of information and what services I use.  </p>

<p><b>Your Personal Data</b></p>
<p>If you send me an email, your email address and name will be stored in my inbox. If you decide to sign up for my newsletter, I will send you emails once in a while (for example to inform you about new apps or new features). You can deregister from this service at any point in time. I will never give your email address or name to someone else. If you want me to remove your email and information, just write me. It might take some time though, as I am all by myself.  </p>

<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
<p>For a better experience, while using my App, I may require you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information. The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
