I am using Google Analytics to get to know my audiance better.

With Google Analytics I can see how often people visit my website, from where they come, what articles they read, and how long they read articles. This helps me greatly to improve my content and get better at writing articles for you. I do not track you personally, the data is anonymously provided to me and used only for improving my website.
